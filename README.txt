B)Java Version 16 Oracle Open JDK Version 19.0.1

C)We were using IntelliJ

D)The hardest part was trying to get all parts, classes, and methods to communicate with each other.
We are all used to having a few different classes and having them communicate with one another,
but never two separate programs running simultaneously. So, we quickly found out, that working
separately and each bringing separate pieces of code didn't really work.
This was also very new material for all of us. Going from making a few buttons in a lecture to making multiple scenes
with all sorts of graphics that communicate with one another was challenging.
Finally, the most difficult part was the server. Learning about sockets
and how to organize and store as well as fetch/receive data from users was completely new
and a very difficult task for all of us. For testing purposes, we pre-wrote Users in the server
to show every function that we did for the application. The server holds one patient
[username: "Sam", password: "realPassword"], doctor [username: "Andrew", password: "doctorPass"],
admin [username: "admin", password: "root"],
feel free to test registering new Users, writing and viewing notes, prescribe medications, make appointments and more.
<< IN ORDER TO RUN THE PROJECT TWO FILES NEED TO BE IN RUN SERVER(the server starter), VirtualHospitalApplication(the JavaFX launcher) >>

E) As of now, everything should be working. We did hard code in a doctor just for ease of use, but everything can be added too and is very dynamic. If we had more time and patience we probably would have liked to implement a few other features and add more exception handling, but we would like to think that we created a very sophisticated and above-and-beyond project with the time and resources we had. We hope you agree as well.
